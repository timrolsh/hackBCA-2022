# WeatherHack++
## A website that helps you decide what to wear for today, and even a few days ahead, based on the weather of your city

---
* It's really easy to use: Type in the same of your city and state (No spaces please)
* You will be brought to a page with a suggestion of what to wear, as well as a few days into the future. Click on those days to see what the site recommends you to wear on those days too!
